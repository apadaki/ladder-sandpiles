# ladder-sandpiles

## Description

A JavaScript web app that simulates a special class of [abelian sandpiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_sandpile_model). In particular, the app simulates the stablization of abelian sandpiles configured with a Bernoulli distribution on the ladder graph $\mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{Z}_2$.

## Usage

As of now, the initial distribution of sandpiles cannot be set manually, and only the finite ladder graph is available. Therefore, usage is limited; the app is designed to visualize a very specific class of sandpiles. 

## Installation

The easiest way to copy the repository files is to enter the following command in a [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)-supported command line environment:

> `git clone https://github.com/apadaki/ladder-sandpiles` 

Next, simply use a [local testing server](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server) or a JavaScript runtime environment to run the project.
